            <p>The Maize & Blue Cupboard at the University of Michigan provides food assistance to members of the
                university community. Its mission is to ensure that individuals—whether facing financial constraints or
                physical limitations—have equitable access to healthy, nutritious, and nourishing food, as well as the
                ability to prepare it for themselves or others. This initiative reflects the university’s commitment to
                addressing food insecurity and promoting well-being within the community.</p>

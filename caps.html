            <h2>Support</h2>
            <h3>Individual Counseling Support</h3>
            <p>Individual Peer Counseling (IPC) is designed to offer a new way to meet the needs of students across the University of Michigan. We are here to support student mental health and offer students a place to vent. Peer counselors are trained in active listening by professional staff here at CAPS. The IPC program connects students with someone of a similar age, interest and background who can serve as a resource or simply someone to “rant” to. While Peer Counselors will keep all information private, IPC is not a substitute for confidential therapy provided by a licensed mental health CAPS staff member.</p>

            <h3>Group Conselling Support</h3>
            <p>Group participation requires completing a 20-30-minute brief consultation appointment and/or a 20-30-minute pre-group screening with the group facilitator. CAPS is committed to providing clinical and supportive group services that are responsive to the needs of our students.</p>

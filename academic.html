            <h2>Registering for Classes</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Planning your schedule</h3>
            <p>To plan your upcoming term, begin by visiting Atlas to review historical course data. Then, check your
                Degree Audit to track your progress and remaining requirements. Explore the UMSI Course Catalog for
                current course offerings, descriptions, and syllabi. Use Schedule Builder to draft a sample schedule,
                and conclude by meeting with an Academic Advisor to finalize your plan.</p>
            <h3>Step 2: Backpacking</h3>
            <p>To register for courses, sign into Wolverine Access and go to the "Student Business" section under the
                "Students" tab. Select "Student Center" and add your chosen courses to your Backpack, a necessary step
                for registration. Be sure to include backup courses in your Backpack in case your preferred ones fill up
                quickly.</p>
            <h3>Step 3: Registration</h3>
            <p>To finalize your course registration, log into Wolverine Access, go to "Student Business" under the
                "Students" tab, and select "Student Center." Check the boxes next to the courses in your Backpack, then
                click "Proceed to Step 2 of 3." Afterward, select "Finish Registration" and ensure a green checkmark
                appears next to each registered course. If a red "X" appears, review the notification and take the
                necessary actions. You can view your schedule by selecting "My Course Schedule" in the Student Center.

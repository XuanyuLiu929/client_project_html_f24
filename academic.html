            <h3>Step 1: Planning your schedule</h3>
            <p>To effectively plan your upcoming term, start by visiting Atlas to review historical course information, then check your Degree Audit to track your course progress and remaining requirements. Next, consult the UMSI Course Catalog for the latest semester offerings, descriptions, and syllabi. Use Schedule Builder to create a sample schedule, and finally, meet with an Academic Advisor to refine and confirm your plan.</p>

Add your selected courses for the term to your Backpack, as this is required for registration. Itâ€™s advisable to add extra courses to your Backpack as backup options in case your preferred courses fill up quickly.</p>
